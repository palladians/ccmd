# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of nurturing an open, inclusive, and progressive environment, we, as contributors, maintainers,
and participants, commit to ensuring that participation in our project and our community is a respectful and
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity
and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Positive, constructive behavior is essential in fostering an enriching environment. Examples of such conduct include:

- Utilizing welcoming and inclusive language.
- Demonstrating respect for differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting and offering constructive criticism.
- Prioritizing the well-being and development of the community.
- Exercising empathy towards other community members and respecting their personal boundaries.

Certain behaviors are considered unacceptable in our community.
Inappropriate behaviors in our community include, but are not limited to:

- Disrespectful language and actions
- Unwelcome attention or advances
- Harassment in any form
- Unauthorized disclosure of private information
- Any other conduct deemed inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers hold the responsibility for elucidating the standards of acceptable behavior.
They are expected to take appropriate, fair, and timely corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior.

They reserve the right to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues,
and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct,
or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that are perceived as inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, public spaces,
and in any situation when an individual represents the project or its community.
This includes, but is not limited to, using an official project email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
Project maintainers may be able to provide more clarification on what is a representation of the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing,
or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported to the project team at team@pallad.xyz.
All complaints will be reviewed, investigated, and we will respond to the circumstances.
The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality concerning the reporter of an incident.

We value your feedback and encourage everyone to voice their concerns or issues.
To ensure the transparency and effectiveness of the process,
we will provide a clear outline of the reporting and enforcement procedures.

Project maintainers who fail to uphold or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face repercussions
as determined by other project leadership members.
These may include temporary or permanent bans and notification to their employer or other community leaders.

We are committed to ensuring that everyone feels safe and welcome.
A clear and comprehensive Code of Conduct is vital to achieving this.
Please uphold this code and treat everyone with respect and kindness.
